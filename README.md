# Invoice Demo
This is a short demo of the invoicing program I made for the first company I worked for.

## Adding
- Create a new invoice by pressing the '+' button. 
- The fields on the form tabbed through. 
- A user can quickly close the form by pressing 'Esc' or clicking anywhere outside of the form. 

## Deleting
- My custom delete button removes the need for a confirmation screen.
- Animation is done by mathematically maniuplating an SVG and is tied to directly to the press duration.
- Invoice fades into nothing as the user holds down the button to give another level of feedback.

## Filtering 
- The filter button is 'intelligent' as it only allows filtering of the type of invoices that are in the user's list.
- If a user presses, holds, and drags off of the button; the filter is cleared. (I wanted to give a visual feedback to this, but didn't have time)
- Search function works while list is filtered. If the filter is cleared while something is being searched for, it keeps search in place in unfiltered list.
