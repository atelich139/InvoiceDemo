# Invoice Demo
This is a short demo of the invoicing program I made for the first company I worked for.

## Adding
- Create a new invoice by pressing the '+' button. 
- The fields on the form tabbed through. 
- A user can quickly close the form by pressing 'Esc' or clicking anywhere outside of the form. 

## Deleting
- My custom delete button removes the need for a confirmation screen.
- The animation is done by mathematically maniuplating an SVG and is tied to directly to the press duration.
